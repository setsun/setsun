## I am Setsun ðŸŒ‡

I'm an engineer and a creative who is interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web: from it's usage as an accessible platform to build/distribute software, to an expressive medium for art + technology.

In that pursuit, I'm interested in novel applications of WebGPU, WebXR, WebAudio, and WebAssembly. In particular, on how they can help build richer, expressive, and performant experiences on the web and beyond.
